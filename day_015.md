# Day 15

1) I started to study React.js
2) I followed the TicTacToe tutorial on the react website https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html 
3) I created a CodeSandbox with it https://codesandbox.io/s/wn4jz91v0k

## REACT

ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front end JavaScript library responsible only for the view layer of the application, created and maintained by Facebook. 

ReactJS uses a virtual DOM based mechanism in order to complete the views in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works fast because it only changes the individual elements of DOM instead of reloading the full DOM every time.

A React application is made up of multiple components, each responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A component may also maintain an internal-state. 

React allows creating components using a domain-specific language called JSX. It permits to write components using HTML while mixing JavaScript events. React converts this into a virtual DOM, and outputs the HTML for us.

React "reacts" to state changes in your components quickly and automatically to rerender the components in the HTML DOM by utilizing the virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of an actual DOM. By doing most of the processing inside the virtual DOM rather than directly in the browser's DOM, React can act quickly and only add, update, and remove components which have changed since the last render cycle occurred.

### Why people choose to program with React?

* React is fast: Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still quick and responsive.
* React is modular: Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. This can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript≈õ maintainability problems.
* React is scalable: Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React preforms best.
* React is flexible:You can use React for insteresting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. Peopleare still figuring out React's potencial.
* React is popular: While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the thruth is that understanding React will make you more employable.
