# Day 1/100

### I started 100 days of code challenge 

1) I created a github repository called 100daysofcode. <br>
https://github.com/ylruiz/100daysofcode

2) I did a project used html & scss and tried to do responsive each section inside the main. <br>

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a collaborative software development platform for hosting projects that use the Git version control system. The code is stored publicly, although it can also be done privately. 

### **“Git” in GitHub**

Git is the free an *Open Source Distributed Version Control System* that's responsible  for  everything  GitHub related that happens locally on your computer. It was started by Linus Trovalds(the same person who created Linux). 

* **Control System** : This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides. 
* **Version Control System** : The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.
* **Distributed Version Control System** : Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.

### **“Hub” in GitHub**

We’ve established that Git is a version control system. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

## What is a MD file?

A MD file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. It is saved in plain text format but includes inline text symbols that define how to format the text (e.g., bold, indentations, headers, table formatting). MD files are designed for authoring plain text documentation that can be easily converted to HTML.

You can study the Markdown syntax at the next webpage: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#span

### Markdown syntax

1) HEADERS

    # This is a h1
    ## This is a h2
    ### This is a h3
    #### This is a h4
    ##### This is a h5
    ###### This is a h6

2) PHRASES EMPHASIZE

    *emphasized*

    **strong emphasized**

3) BLOCKQUOTE
    
    > This is a blockquote
    >
    > This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.

4) LISTS

    Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (*, +, and -) as list markers. That is a example: 

    * element 1 using *
    + element 2 using +
    - element 3 using -

    Ordered lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers:

    1) element 1
    2) element 2
    3) element 3

5) LINKS

    - Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text:
    
         This is an [example link](http://example.com/)

        Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:
        
        This is an [example link with title](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

    - Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document:

        I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
        [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

        [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
        [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
        [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

        The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters, numbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:

        I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].

[ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/

6) IMAGES

    - Inline (titles are optional):
    
        > ! [alt text] (/path/to/img.jpg "Title")

    - Reference-style:

        > ! [alt text] [id] 

        > [id] : /path/to/img.jpg "Title"

## HTML

## CSS

## JavaScript

* JavaScript is primarily knowm as the language most modern web browwers.
* JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language used for incresingly complex web development and beyond!.
* JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites.

### Console

In JavaScript, the **console** keyword refers to an object, a colletion of data and actions, that we use in our code. 

One action, or method, that is built into the **console** object is the *.log()* method. When we write *console.log()* what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.

### Comments

Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add other useful annotations.

There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

1) A simgle line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it:
    > // Prints 5 to the console
    > console.log(5);

    >console.log(5); // Prints 5

2) A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.

    > /* 
    > This is all commented
    >console.log(10);
    >*/

### Data Types

Data Types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming.

In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental date types:

1) **Number**: Any number, including numbers with decimals(4, 23.5).
2) **String**: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard(letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: *'...'* or double quotes *"..."*. Though we prefer single quotes. 
3) **Boolean**: This date type only has two possible values *true* or *false*. 
4) **Null**: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword *null*.
5) **Undefined**: This data type is denoted by the keyword *undefined*. It also represents the absence of a value though it has different use that *null*.
6) **Symbol**: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding.
7) **Object**: Collections of related data.

## Arithmetic Operators

<table>
        <tr>
            <td>Add</td>
            <td>+</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Subtract</td>
            <td>-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Multiply</td>
            <td>*</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Divided</td>
            <td>/</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Remainder</td>
            <td>%</td>
        </tr>
<table>  

### String Concatenation

Operators aren't just for numbers. When a + operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to the left string. 

This process of appending to ahother is called concatenation. 

### Properties

Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string.

> console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5

The . is another operator called the dot operator.

### Methods

Methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods. 

> console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'

> console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H)); // Prints true

> console.log(' Remove whitespace '.trim()) // Prints 'Remove whitespace'

You can find a list of built-in string methods in the  [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype).
