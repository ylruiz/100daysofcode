## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a collaborative software development platform for hosting projects that use the Git version control system. The code is stored publicly, although it can also be done privately. 

### **“Git” in GitHub**

Git is an *Open Source Distributed Version Control System* that was started by Linus Trovalds(the same person who created Linux).

* **Control System** : This basically means that Git is a content tracker. So Git can be used to store content — it is mostly used to store code due to the other features it provides. 
* **Version Control System** : The code which is stored in Git keeps changing as more code is added. Also, many developers can add code in parallel. So Version Control System helps in handling this by maintaining a history of what changes have happened. Also, Git provides features like branches and merges, which I will be covering later.
* **Distributed Version Control System** : Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server, but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers’ computers. Git is a Distributed Version Control System since the code is present in every developer’s computer.

### **“Hub” in GitHub**

We’ve established that Git is a version control system. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

## What is a MD file?

A MD file is a text file created using one of several possible dialects of the Markdown language. It is saved in plain text format but includes inline text symbols that define how to format the text (e.g., bold, indentations, headers, table formatting). MD files are designed for authoring plain text documentation that can be easily converted to HTML.
