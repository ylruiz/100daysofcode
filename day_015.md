## REACT

React is a JavaScript library built by Facebook. 

### Why people choose to program with React?

* React is fast: Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still quick and responsive.
* React is modular: Instead of writing large, dense files of code, you can write many smaller, reusable files. This can be a beautiful solution to JavaScript≈õ maintainability problems.
* React is scalable: Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React preforms best.
* React is flexible:You can use React for insteresting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. Peopleare still figuring out React's potencial.
* React is popular: While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the thruth is that understanding React will make you more employable.
