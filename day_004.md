# Day 4/100

1) I made a form submission before using the express app that created day 3/100 and body-parser module.

2) I created app.js and using the express module, I allow it to accept a query parameter called `name` and return a response with `Hello ${name}`. I taked into account the case when no name is provided and say `Hello world!` instead.

3) I added a readme to the project , a file called Readme.md that contains instructions for installing the dependencies and running the server.
