# Day 4/100

1) Using the express app that created day 3/100, I allow it to accept a query parameter called `name` and return a response with `Hello ${name}`. I taked into account the case when no name is provided and say `Hello world!` instead.

2) I added a readme to the project , i.e. a file called Readme.md that contains instructions for installing the dependencies and running the server.
