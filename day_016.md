## Create React App

create-react-app is a React app boilerplate generator created by Facebook. It provides a development environment configured for ease-of-use with minimal setup, including:
* ES6 and JSX transpilation
* Dev server with hot module reloading
* Code linting
* CSS auto-prefixing
* Build script with JS, CSS and image bundling, and sourcemaps
* Jest testing framework

### Installation

First, install create-react-app globally with node package manager (npm).

    > npm install -g create-react-app

Then run the generator in your chosen directory.

    > create-react-app my-app

Navigate to the newly created directory and run the start script.

    > cd my-app/ 
    > npm start

### Configuration

create-react-app is intentionally non-configurable by default. If non-default usage is required, for example, to use a
compiled CSS language such as Sass, then the eject command can be used.

    > npm run eject

This allows editing of all configuration files. N.B. this is an irreversible process.

### Build React App

To build your app for production ready, run following command

    > npm run build
