# Day 5/100

I added a route called `contact-us` that includes an about form. It should satisfy the user histories below:
<br> 
- As an user ypu can visit the /contact-us page and it loads.
- As an user you can enter your email address and your name in the contact form and submit it.
- As an user you can add an optional message in the contact form.
