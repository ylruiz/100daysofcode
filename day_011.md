# Day 11

I updated the app with the followings required:

1) As a user I can see a link in the header to login into the app. 
2) As I user I can click on the header link and go to a login page.
3) As a user I can enter my email address and password an submit the form.
4) If my email address is "hello@test.com" and my password is "hello" I get redirected into a the admin area.
5) In the admin area I can see my email address.
6) If the user is wrong I get back an error message after submitting the form.

In addition, I deployed the app to heroku: https://yunet-webserver.herokuapp.com
